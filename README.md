# visualize_titanic_data

## Summary
Visualization that shows passenger information between those passengers who survived and those who died. Using d3.js and dimple.js.


## Design
I found tendency of those who survived and those who died. By categolizing passenger by sex, passenger class and fare, it is clearly relavant to survival rate. So I chose stacked bar chart and box plot to explain them.

for feedback 1:
Ajusted the width and height of plots.

## Feedback
include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

1. well, it seems that females are more likely to survive than males in general and the higher the passenger class the more likely you are to survive, which is the same as the more paid for the ticket the more likely you are to survive. i have no questions about the data because it was a given dataset. the graphic was fairly straightforward and clear, although the box plot is somewhat redundant because its pretty much the same as the passenger class graph. a suggestion would be to try to fit the graphs to the page so that you dont have to scroll down, plus the width of the bars are kind of wide and use up space unecessarily.

  <h1>Who Survived in Titanic Disaster?</h1>

  <div id="first_plot">
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The graph left shows the number of Male and Female survived in Titanic disaster.
        It seems like female was more likely to survive in Titanic accident.
        I think there are two reasons that caused this tendency.
        First, female are more likely to be taken on rescue boats than male.
        Second, female can keep their body temperture efficiently thanks to their body fat.
        So they could stand the coldness in the sea.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="second_plot"></div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The graph right shows the number of people who survived or not. There seems to be tendency that Upper class passengers have higher survival rate. Passengers those who were in First class might be evacuated preferentially from ship.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="third_plot"></div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The graph left is the boxplot of passengers' fare between survived people and died people. There seems to be relationship between fare and survival rate. The more you pay, the more likely you survive.</p>
